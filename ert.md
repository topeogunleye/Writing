React is a tool used by many to make websites. It has a big collection of helpers that make building websites easier and better for people who visit them.

When we build websites with React, picking the right helpers is very important. The right tools can make our work much faster and easier. They help us fix problems and add cool things to our websites without a lot of trouble. In this article, weâ€™ll learn about some great React tools that can do a lot for us, even though not many people know about them.

**A Quick Look at React and Its Building Blocks**

React is like a big box of building blocks for websites. Inside this box, there are many small pieces that we can use to make our website do different things. Some blocks help us start building quickly, some blocks help us find and fix mistakes, and some blocks help us keep track of all the information on our website. By choosing the right blocks, we can build websites that work well and are nice to use.

In the world of React, developers have some cool tools that help them build websites. When building web pages with React, three tools can make your life easier:

**Vite** is a modern and fast build tool that significantly improves the developer experience. It serves code via native ES modules, making it extremely fast and efficient. With Vite, you can start a new project with a simple command, `npm create vite@latest my-app --template react`, and it will quickly set up a new React project with sensible defaults and best practices. Vite is designed to offer a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

**React Developer Tools**

React Developer Tools is a browser extension available for Chrome and Firefox that provides a React tab in the developer console. This powerful tool allows developers to inspect the React component hierarchy, including props, state, and hooks, in real-time. It's an invaluable asset for debugging and optimizing React components, ensuring that you can maintain a clear understanding of your application's structure and flow.

**Redux DevTools**

For applications that utilize Redux for state management, Redux DevTools is a must-have. It offers time-travel debugging, allowing you to navigate through the history of your state changes and understand the impact of each action on the app's state. The tool's features include the ability to inspect every state and action payload, re-evaluate dispatched actions, and even export the state history for analysis and testing purposes.
